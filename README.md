# file_organizer

A script that looks through any folder you tell it to and moves the files to respective subfolders based on the file type.

The organizational system for this was borrowed from github.com/kallehallden, but I feel like my implementation is different enough for this to deserve it's own repo.


# Command Line Arguments

You can run the script from the command line and provide the source and base destination folders as arguments. No additional dependancies need to be installed, all packages used are part of the Python Standard Library

To run the script from cmd, cd to the project directory, and run the following command

            python fileorganizer_windows.py source_folder base_destination_folder 
            
            (or)
            
            python3 fileorganizer_linux.py source_folder base_destination_folder
            
depending on what OS you're running            

Replace source_folder and base_destination_folder as per your requirements.
